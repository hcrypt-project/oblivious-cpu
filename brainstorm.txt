Brainstorming:

Rather than re-processing the network in tick(), we should be building a network of operations that include the 
entire system state. This will result in a directed data-flow graph that we may be able to optimize statically 
(ie: coalesce or prune some operations).

Once we have a directed data-flow graph, we could generate a very simple elementary bytecode that could be 
processed by a Java or C implementation of a fully-homomorphic system. This bytecode would consist of simple 
operations such as:

  temp_1 = xor location_1, location_2
  temp_2 = and temp_1, location_3
